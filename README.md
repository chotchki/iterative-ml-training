# iterative-ml-training
Playground to understand machine learning training techniques, especially how to incrementally update models

# Todo List
- [ ] Setup a ML pipeline to support training research
  - [ ] Create a set of generators to generate input for the evaluation
  - [ ] Create the simplest implementation of a neural net as a basis to iterate on


# Goals (pie in the sky)
Understand the limitations that cause ML models to not be able to grow and evolve

# Non Goals
Performance / GPU acceleration
